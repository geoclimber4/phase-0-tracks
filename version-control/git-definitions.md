# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? 

Version control is, by way of cloud storage or remote computers, the ability of team members to work on various versions of a project at once, then push them back to the master in a way that will not make a mess of the master code.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is one version of the code that is being edited. You work on a branch so that you can commit it back to the central project as one piece. It allows to you check for errors first, and to not change the central project until the changes are checked and verified.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is basically a save point. A good commit message with start in present tense, and give an indication of what this particular saved version added or changed in the code.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when two branches have had changes that cannot be merged automatically by Git, so it must be resolved with some work first, then merged.
