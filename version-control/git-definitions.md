# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is the ability to track changes over time and have multiple versions of the same code that are labeled for use. Without it, collaboration between multiple coders would be very risky and difficult.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a version of the code that is labeled for easy use. It allows you to modify a piece of code without changing the original code. Then, you can merge it back with the master branch at any point in the future when necessary.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a change to a piece of code. It also should always have a message or little note that tells you what was done to the code.

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when you go to merge 2 branches of code and have changes in each that overlap. For example, If I had two branches and deleted a markdown file in one and edited it in the second, I would have a merge conflict.
