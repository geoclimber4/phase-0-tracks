What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Linux is free and open source which makes it great for a VPS. Linux is great to experiment with as well for virtual machines. It also is great for coding by utilizing the terminal. (I'm using Ubuntu on a Windows dual-booted machine)

In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
A virtual private server is like a remote computer that operates in a vaccum. The advantage of a VPN i sbeing able to run lunux programs from any operating system. It also is great for hosting a website that can be accessible 24/7 and not take up resources on your own computer. 

Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
It's bad as it root users have super user rights, which means they can modify any code even if it breaks the machine.
