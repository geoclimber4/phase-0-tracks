Display the information in one table (either table is fine).
	sqlite> SELECT * FROM buildings;
	1|2320
	2|2310
	3|2304
	4|1934
	sqlite> SELECT * FROM apartment;
	1|John Smith|101|true|1
	2|Sally Jones|2B|true|2
	3|Don Johnson|1B|true|3
	4|Adam Adams|202|true|4
	5|vacant|1B|false|2


Update an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).
	sqlite> UPDATE apartment SET name = "Jonny Smith" Where name = "John Smith";
	sqlite> SELECT * FROM apartment;
	1|Jonny Smith|101|true|1
	2|Sally Jones|2B|true|2
	3|Don Johnson|1B|true|3
	4|Adam Adams|202|true|4
	5|vacant|1B|false|2


Display the information in both tables using one query.
	sqlite> SELECT * FROM apartment, buildings WHERE apartment.building_id = buildings.id;
	1|Jonny Smith|101|true|1|1|2320
	2|Sally Jones|2B|true|2|2|2310
	3|Don Johnson|1B|true|3|3|2304
	4|Adam Adams|202|true|4|4|1934
	5|vacant|1B|false|2|2|2310


Display a narrower selection of columns (fewer columns than all of them, in other words) from both tables using one query.

	sqlite> SELECT apartment.name, buildings.building FROM apartment JOIN buildings ON apartment.building_id = buildings.id;
	Jonny Smith|2320
	Sally Jones|2310
	Don Johnson|2304
	Adam Adams|1934
	vacant|2310

	sqlite> SELECT apartment.name, apartment.number, buildings.building FROM apartment JOIN buildings ON apartment.building_id = buildings.id;
	Jonny Smith|101|2320
	Sally Jones|2B|2310
	Don Johnson|1B|2304
	Adam Adams|202|1934
	vacant|1B|2310


Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

	sqlite> DELETE FROM apartment WHERE name="vacant";
	sqlite> SELECT apartment.name, apartment.number, buildings.building FROM apartment JOIN buildings ON apartment.building_id = buildings.id;
	Jonny Smith|101|2320
	Sally Jones|2B|2310
	Don Johnson|1B|2304
	Adam Adams|202|1934
