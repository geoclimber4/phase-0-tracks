You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?
	sqlite> SELECT businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews
	   ...> LEFT OUTER JOIN users ON reviews.user_id=users.id
	   ...> LEFT OUTER JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id=businesses.id;
	Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|Bradford|Pitt|1|Nothing lasts...
	Lotus Yoga|Mandy|Kaling|5|Really found my chi
	Lotus Yoga|Angela|Jolie|3|Great except Mandy wouldn't shut up


There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment:
	sqlite> SELECT businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews
	   ...> LEFT OUTER JOIN users ON reviews.user_id=users.id
	   ...> LEFT OUTER JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id=businesses.id;
	Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|Bradford|Pitt|1|Nothing lasts...
	Lotus Yoga|Mandy|Kaling|5|Really found my chi
	Lotus Yoga|Angela|Jolie|3|Great except Mandy wouldn't shut up



How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 
	sqlite> SELECT businesses.name, users.first_name, users.last_name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews
	   ...> LEFT OUTER JOIN users ON reviews.user_id=users.id
	   ...> LEFT OUTER JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id=businesses.id
	   ...> WHERE businesses.name="Lotus Yoga";
	Lotus Yoga|Mandy|Kaling|5|Really found my chi
	Lotus Yoga|Angela|Jolie|3|Great except Mandy wouldn't shut up
